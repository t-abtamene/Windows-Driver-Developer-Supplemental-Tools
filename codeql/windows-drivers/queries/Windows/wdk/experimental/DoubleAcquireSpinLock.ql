// Now.  The above only catches cases where there is _no_
// possible cfg where the lock is not released.  So what about
// cases based off of there being branches where it's not released?
// 
// We'd need to block on any data paths that pass through a blocking
// point.  And our "sink" would become the end of the dispatch function
// in which this was originally called.  So that's two things that get tricky
// quick.  In particular: how smart is the data flow model? Is it smart enough
// to tell when condition A holds true in two separate places?

// Perhaps like this: a data flow from function entry to acquire lock.
// And then a second flow from lock acquisition to exit, modulo releases.

// considered tainted at future references to it?
